## Neural networks applications

This project seeks to apply neural network models for a binary classification problem (fraud detection). Most importantly, a strategy for hyper-parameters definition is implemented in order to explore possibilities of parameters tuning in the context of neural network modeling, which has a particularly large set of hyper-parameters to be specified so performance can be optimized.

The repository contains theoretical discussion that has based empirical applications and the analysis of results for the adopted stratgy of hyper-parameters definition. Besides, codes and data with outcomes from the tests are also presented.
