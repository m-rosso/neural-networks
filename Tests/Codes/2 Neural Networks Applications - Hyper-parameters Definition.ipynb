    "So far, learning rate has been approached by the use of Adam optimizer, which dynamically calculates learning rates parameter-specific. Besides, all hyper-parameters of Adam has been using their Keras default values. This implies values of $\\eta = 0.001$, $\\beta_1 = 0.9$ and $\\beta_2 = 0.999$. While $\\eta$ is the initial learning rate, $\\beta_1$ and $\\beta_2$ control the decay of learning rates. The decay causes faster learning during initial updates, sequentially slowing down as iterations take place. Therefore, the higher decay parameters are, the more dynamic the learning process will be. Note that no decay (and no momentum) results in standard stochastic gradient descent (SGD).\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Consequently, two tests shoud be implemented in order to fine tune the learning process: first, alternative values for Adam hyper-parameters will be used; then, tests will focus on different settings for SGD optimizer. The comparison between Adam and SGD optimizers will result from these two tests.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "All estimations will follow the best alternatives derived from tests above:\n",
    "* Random samples of training and validation data.\n",
    "* *Following results of tests from an earlier section, cross-entropy cost function will be used. Regarding activation functions, sigmoid will be applied for the neuron in the output layer, while tanh activation function will be used for neurons in hidden layers, since this alternative has shown the best results during tests.*\n",
    "* Fitting hyper-parameters: *after previous tests, mini-batch size is set to $S = 512$, while number of epochs is still kept as low as possible to simplify estimations, $T = 10$.*\n",
    "* *After tests for number of neurons and number of hidden layers, the architecture will be given by two hidden layers with the following number of neurons:*\n",
    "    * $J_1 = \\sqrt{num\\_inputs*num\\_outputs}$.\n",
    "    * $J_2 = J_1/2$.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "* *The section concerning regularization has shown that L2 regularization with $\\lambda = 1e-5$ is the best alternative to improve generalization by using standard regularization techniques.*\n",
    "* *Previous tests have pointed to the adequacy of using dropout layers with parameters $\\rho_{input} = 0.1$ and $\\rho_{hidden} = 0.1$ for input and hidden layers, respectively.*\n",
    "* No early stopping.\n",
    "* Conclusions will be guided by performance metrics evaluated on validation data. Defining the best SGD setting will also make use of cost function evaluated on validation data.\n",
    "* Averaging: a collection of 100 estimations will be implemented, so performance metrics can be assessed in terms of average and standard deviation."

    "This final round of tests aims to explore even further three hyper-parameters that have shown some potential to contribute more with improving performance metrics: mini-batch size, parameter of input dropout, parameter of hidden dropout, and Adam hyper-parameters. Tests will occur subsequently as follows:\n",
    "* Mini-batch size: a grid of three best ranked values will be tested again: $S \\in [32, 512, 1024]$.\n",
    "* Input and hidden dropouts: the best ranked values of $\\rho_{input} = 0.1$ and $\\rho_{output} = 0.1$ will be opposed to no dropout, $\\rho_{input} = 0$ and $\\rho_{hidden}$.\n",

    "All estimations will follow the best alternatives derived from tests above (except when the values for the hyper-parameter are to be tested):\n",
    "* Random samples of training and validation data.\n",
    "* *Following results of tests from an earlier section, cross-entropy cost function will be used. Regarding activation functions, sigmoid will be applied for the neuron in the output layer, while tanh activation function will be used for neurons in hidden layers, since this alternative has shown the best results during tests.*\n",
    "* Fitting hyper-parameters: *after previous tests, mini-batch size is set to $S = 512$, while number of epochs is still kept as low as possible to simplify estimations, $T = 10$.*\n",
    "* *After further tests for number of neurons and number of hidden layers, the architecture will be given by one hidden layer with the following number of neurons:* $J_1 = (num\\_inputs + num\\_outputs)*0.1$.\n",
    "* *For the learning rate setting, tests have shown that Adam is a better option when compared to SGD optimizer. The best specification of its hyper-parameters is as follows: $learning\\_rate = 0.001$, $\\beta_1 = 0.75$ and $\\beta_2 = 0.9999$. This represents a modification to default values ($learning\\_rate = 0.001$, $\\beta_1 = 0.9$, $beta_2 = 0.999$).*\n",
    "* *The section concerning regularization has shown that L2 regularization with $\\lambda = 1e-5$ is the best alternative to improve generalization by using standard regularization techniques.*\n",
    "* *Previous tests have pointed to the adequacy of using dropout layers with parameters $\\rho_{input} = 0.1$ and $\\rho_{hidden} = 0.1$ for input and hidden layers, respectively.*\n",
    "* No early stopping.\n",
    "* *Testing alternative distributions for weights initialization has shown that Glorot Uniform is the best option among those tested.*\n",
    "* Conclusions will be guided by performance metrics evaluated on validation data.\n",
    "* Averaging: a collection of 100 estimations will be implemented, so performance metrics can be assessed in terms of average and standard deviation."
