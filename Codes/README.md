In this folder, we found codes used during tests based on the training of neural network models. Some of the files are scripts with validation and data transformation classes and functions, besides a script with a class object that easily implements neural network modeling with Keras framework. Other files are the Jupyter notebooks containing codes for executing tests and analyzing their results.
